\usage{
ExtAdjNormData(
  CountData,
  norm.method = c("DEseq.norm", "TMM", "log1p"),
  group,
  method = "ML",
  RNAspike.use = FALSE,
  spikes,
  spike.conc,
  CE.range = c(0.01, 0.5)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CountData}{This is a gene-by-cell raw count matrix.}

\item{norm.method}{There are three distinct statistical normalization methods for scRNA-seq count data:DESeq2, a maximum likelihood approach described by Ye et al. (2027); TMM, a trimmed mean method introduced by Robinson et al. (2010), both designed to correct for library size and compositional biases; and a third method, which is the log1p standard normalization method for scRNA-seq data.}

\item{group}{This is a vector of factors with 2 levels that serves as a grouping variable that assigns each column (cell) of the count matrix to one of two predefined experimental conditions.}

\item{method}{A string that specifies the method for computing capture efficiencies. ("ML" or "")}

\item{RNAspike.use}{This is a logical parameter. If this parameter is set to TRUE, then it requires you to provide spike counts (spike) and spike concentration (spike.conc) information.}

\item{spikes}{This is the observed count matrix for spike-in transcripts, where each row is a spike-in and each column is a cell. It's only required if you set RNAspike.use to TRUE.}

\item{spike.conc}{This is a vector of theoretical counts for each spike-in transcript in a single cell, and it's only required if you set RNAspike.use to TRUE.}

\item{CE.range}{This is a two-element vector that sets the lower and upper limits for the estimated range of capture efficiencies.}
}
\value{
This function returns a list of two distinct capture efficiency adjusted normalized counts matrices, based on the number of factors in the group vector for the scRNA-seq data.
}
\description{
This function adjusts the scRNA-seq data by capture efficiency for each cell, then normalizes the adjusted matrix, and finally splits the matrix into two distinct matrices based on the number of factors in the group vector.
