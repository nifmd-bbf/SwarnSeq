\title{Cell Capture Efficiency Estimating Function}
\usage{
CapEff(CountData, CE.range, RNAspike.use, spikes, spike.conc, method)
}
\arguments{
\item{CountData}{This is a gene-by-cell raw count matrix.}

\item{CE.range}{This is a two-element vector that sets the lower and upper limits for the estimated range of capture efficiencies.}

\item{RNAspike.use}{This is a logical parameter. If this parameter is set to TRUE, then it requires you to provide spike counts (spike) and spike concentration (spike.conc) information.}

\item{spikes}{This is the observed count matrix for spike-in transcripts, where each row is a spike-in and each column is a cell. It's only required if you set RNAspike.use to TRUE.}

\item{spike.conc}{This is a vector of theoretical counts for each spike-in transcript in a single cell, and it's only required if you set RNAspike.use to TRUE.}

\item{method}{A string that specifies the method for computing capture efficiencies. ("ML" or "")}
}
\value{
This function returns the capture efficiencies of all the cells as a vector.
}
\description{
This function estimates the capture efficiencies of cells from single-cell RNA-seq studies.
This function takes ERCC spike-in transcript and molecular concentration data, if available.
If spike-ins are not available, it uses count expression data.
